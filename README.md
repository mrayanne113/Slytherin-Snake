# Game Time Project (FE - Module 2)

Recreate the classic game Snake using Object Oriented Programming. 


##Goals

[ ] Use OOP to drive the design of the game and the code
[ ] Separate business-logic code from view-related code
[ ] Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application


##Playability Features

[X] Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
[X] Allow the user to start a new game
[X] Display a score (if applicable)
[ ] Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself (this might include instructions on how to play, a high score saved in localStorage, etc. Think of what would be most intuitive for your particular game.)
